**WARNING: I don't maintain this project anymore so I don't recommend you use it.**

You can use instead https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync which is a fork from
this project with considerable changes to address a lot of its shortcomings.

*(Also monitor closely https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync2 which will use the
recent official Google Photo API and should be a more sustainable solution).*


====================
 Google Photos Sync
====================

Google Photos Sync is a simple script that will synchronize on a local filesystem
all the photos stored in your Google Photos account.

All the photo filenames are automatically renamed according to the date and camera model 
and are stored in a ``YEAR/MONTH/`` folder hierarchy.


Install and configure
---------------------

Just run ``python setup.py`` from the source directory to install it in your system.

In order to work, ``gphotos-sync`` first needs a valid client id linked to a project
authorized to use the Google Drive API. It is not provided in the distribution.

To do so:

* Create a project on `Google Developer Console`_, following the `Creating a project procedure`_,

* Authorize it to use the Google Drive API, following the `Activating and desactivating APIs procedure`_,

* Create a Client ID by following the `setting up oauth 2.0 procedure`_ with application type set to `Other`,

* Once the client ID is created, download it as ``client_secret.json`` and save it under the application 
  configuration directory:

  - ``~/Library/Application Support/gphotos-sync/`` under Mac OS X,
  - ``~/.config/gphotos-sync/`` under Linux.

.. _`Google Developer Console`: https://developers.google.com/console/
.. _`Creating a project procedure`: https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#creatingaproject
.. _`Activating and Desactivating APIs procedure`: https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#activating-and-deactivating-apis
.. _`setting up oauth 2.0 procedure`: https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#setting-up-oauth-20


How to use it
-------------

Once the script is configured, you are now ready to use it using the simple following command line::

    gphotos-sync TARGET_DIRECTORY

The first time, it will ask you to go to an url and copy back the authorization code in order
to authorize the client to access your Google Photos through Google Drive.

It will then begin to download all photos locally.
